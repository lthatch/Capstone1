# US Police Shootings

Police shootings have been a hot topic recently in the US. I wanted to take a closer look at the data to gain a better understanding of why these shootings were occuring, if they were justified, and if any correlations existed. 

## Are Police shootings increasing?

The first question I asked myself was, are police shootings increasing? Based on what I have heard recently on the news, I expected them to be increasing. My dataset ranged from 2015 to the first half of 2020. I decided to graph the total number of police shootings by year. I also excluded 2020 so the data would not be skewed.
